WebcamMouse
===========

COMP 473 / 6731 Pattern Recognition Project


When adding the project to an IDE all the files in ./lib/ have to be added to the build path.

A compiled version (WebcamMouse.jar) is available in ./ that runs by double clicking it,
or by navigating to ./ in a terminal and typing the command "java -jar WebcamMouse.jar" (without the quotation marks)

java 1.7 is required to make sure the program runs without issues.
